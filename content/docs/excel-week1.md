For this tutorial, we'll use data on the most popular content on Netflix. 

You'll be creating a tracker to see how many of the top Netflix titles you've seen or want to see! The end result will look like this:

To download the data:
1. Go to [netflix.com/tudum/top10/​](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10)
2. Click `Lists` at the top
3. Next to “Most Popular Lists” click Excel
4. Save your file
5. Open up the file in Excel or Google Sheets

> ❓ **Should I use Excel or Google Sheets?**
>
> You can complete this tutorial using Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets (or even Apple Numbers)! 
>
> Most commonly-used features in Excel also exist in Google Sheets​ (note that the menus or names may be slightly different).​ 
>
> Same is true for Mac vs. PC​, there are some variations in menus and keyboard shortcuts​.


## Cells, Rows, and Columns

First things first: rows vs. columns!
* Rows go horizontally (left to right) and are labeled with numbers (e.g. "Row 5")
* Columns go vertically (up and down) and are labeled with letters (e.g. "Column G")
* Cells are labeled by their row and column, e.g. "Cell 5G"

## Cell Formatting


## Data Validation

Create new another column:​

    A column that called “Seen” with a dropdown menu for “No”, “No but on my list”, “Yes and loved it”, ”Yes and didn’t love it”​

    Add an error message to the validation​

    Fill out the field on a few rows to make sure it works!
