For this week's tutorial, we'll combine all the knowledge we've gained so far to create a dashboard to meet client requirements.

So far, we've covered formulas, including row-based formulas, summary formulas, XLOOKUP, cumulative formulas, pivot tables, and pivot charts.

## Our project this week

The COO of the podcast network has asked you to create a dashboard to track the company’s top key metrics related to revenue. The dashboard should include these metrics:
1. Monthly downloads by podcast content category
2. The top 5 advertisers in 2025 by revenue
3. Cumulative revenue so far this year, compared to last year
4. One more stat or chart you think the COO might like to see

## Creating components for your dashboard
* Each chart or table in your dashboard is called a component
    * Work on one component at a time
* Sometimes easiest to work on each in its own sheet
* To create a chart, create a pivot table first, to make sure data is grouped correctly 
* To create a single stat (e.g. overall total, average, etc.) you can type a formula directly into a cell
* Add enough labels/titles that you know what each component is
* Don’t worry about colors or specific formatting until all your components are drafted 

**Let's try it out:** This guide won't include specific instructions for each component -- you'll need to work through it yourself! If you need a refresher, take a look through the notes from previous weeks, and ask if you need help. 

Here are a few hints for each component to help you get started! 

### Component #1: Downloads by Category
* Create a Pivot Table
* Option to visualize this as a pivot table or a pivot chart (pie chart)! 

### Component #2: Top 5 Advertisers in 2024 
* Use an `XLOOKUP` formula to bring show downloads
* Use a math formula to get spend 
    * Hint: `Revenue = CPM*(downloads/1000)`
* Create a Pivot Table
* Filter your pivot table by Value > `Top 10` > type in 5 items
* Add a Pivot Chart (horizontal bars)
* Add a Timeline to your pivot chart on campaign month

### Component #3: Cumulative Revenue YoY
* In the 2025 sheet, use DATE formula to convert months to dates (year = 2025)
* In your pivot table, display the revenue sum as a `Running Total of` the campaign month
* Sort both by date
* Create 2 charts (one for each year) and consider adding a slicer by advertiser

### Component #4: Dealer's Choice

Create your own component! Try to use a different kind of table or chart type than the first three components. Some ideas to help you brainstorm:
* What information would you want to know about the network's revenue if you were the COO?
* Which podcasts bring in the most revenue?
