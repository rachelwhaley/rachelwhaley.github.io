## How to think about using AI tools while learning Excel/SQL/Python

I highly recommend reading [ChatGPT and You](https://www.practicaldatascience.org/notebooks/PDS_not_yet_in_coursera/99_advice/llms.html) (Duke University). Here's a brief excerpt:

"Most practicing data scientists use LLMs like student research assistants—they let the LLMs write the first draft of code, then review and refine the code based on their own expertise. This is extremely useful, but it does mean that to use LLMs effectively, a data scientist still has to learn to program on their own.

And that’s where the danger lies with LLMs: while LLMs are error-prone when it comes to real-world data science projects, they’re shockingly good at the types of basic programming exercises that are the staple of introductory data science and programming courses.

...we can’t evaluate whether an LLM has correctly written the analysis code we asked for by looking at the results. Rather, in data science, **our confidence in our conclusions depends almost entirely on our confidence in how our results were generated**, and that can only come from reading, testing, and understanding our own code." *(emphasis added)*

## Rachel's Rules for using AI effectively​
1. Always make sure you understand the formula/code it wrote​
    * Can you explain it in your own words?​
2. Always try the formula/code yourself and gut-check the results ​
3. Does the output look right on a few examples? ​
4. Always assume it's wrong until you fully check that it's correct -- look at it critically​
5. What are the logic steps you'd follow if you did this by hand? How do those compare to the formula? ​

AI assistants tend to be much more effective if you write out a first draft of your formula/code, and then ask for assistance to resolve any errors you're seeing or to update it to do a more complex operation. (See "Augmentation" in Anthropic's [free AI Literacy course](https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-framework-foundations?next=%2Fai-fluency-framework-foundations%2F291870), which draws from the [Framework for AI Fluency](https://ringling.libguides.com/ai/framework)).
